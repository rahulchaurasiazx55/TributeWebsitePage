# TributeWebsitePage
A tribute page is basically an overview of someone whom we admire in our life. In this article, we are creating a tribute webpage of Virat Kohli using HTML and CSS. We will add an image of him at the center (below the title) and create a box beneath that image. Inside that box, we will write a few of his achievements and details. We will use div tag and p tag to write the details and img tag for image. Then using CSS, we will align and beautify the design.
